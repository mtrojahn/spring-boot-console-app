# spring-boot-console-app
Simple console only "Hello World" spring-boot application. (Spring Boot 1.3.0)

In this example I'll try to show you how to create a simple console application to send out the traditional "Hello World" using spring-boot on a Maven project. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible for now and I'll most likely use this code as base for new posts.
